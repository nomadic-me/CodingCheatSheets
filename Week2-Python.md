### [Extended Slices](https://docs.python.org/release/2.3.5/whatsnew/section-slices.html)

https://docs.python.org/release/2.3.5/whatsnew/section-slices.html

For example, you can now easily extract the elements of a list that have even indexes:
```python
>>> L = range(10)
>>> L[::2]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

Negative values also work to make a copy of the same list in reverse order:
```python
>>> L[::-1]
[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```

This also works for tuples, arrays, and strings:
```python
>>> s='abcd'
>>> s[::2]
'ac'
>>> s[::-1]
'dcba'
````

### [range() Function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp)

https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp

Example

Create a sequence of numbers from 3 to 5, and print each item in the sequence:
```python
x = range(3, 6)
for n in x:
  print(n) 
```

Example
Create a sequence of numbers from 3 to 19, but increment by 2 instead of 1:
```python
x = range(3, 20, 2)
for n in x:
  print(n)
```

Do I need to store the global variab... ![From Stack Overflow: Using global variables in a function | How can I create or use a global variable in a function?](Resources/Images/link-previews/2022-03-05-Stack_Overflow-Using_global_variables_in_a_fu.png)

```python
globvar = 0

def set_globvar_to_one():
    global globvar    # Needed to modify global copy of globvar
    globvar = 1

def print_globvar():
    print(globvar)     # No need for global declaration to read value of globvar

set_globvar_to_one()
print_globvar()       # Prints 1
```
